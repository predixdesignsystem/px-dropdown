# v4.9.3

- Use margin right and left to avoid browser specific prefix fix for rtl space issue.
- Re-add the padding styles that was removed that caused regression.

# v4.9.2

- Resolved regression in iconic menu trigger size.

# v4.9.1

- Fixed Dropdown icon spacing issue when the rendering direction is "rtl" Right-To-Left.

# v4.9.0

- Added `--px-icon-flex-grow` CSS variable for optionally allowing the dropdown to fill its container.

# v4.8.1

- Fixed regression in px-icon sizes.

# v4.8.0

- Added a new property to make the number of selected values used in the trigger label variable.
- The new property is `display-value-count` and its default value is `1`, which is the current default behaviour.

# v4.7.10

- Added read-only and disabled-viewable properties to px-dropdown.
- read-only allows user to open px-dropdown in an active state but they can not select items
- disabled-viewable allows user to open px-dropdown even though its in a disabled state but they can not select items

# v4.7.9

- fix max-width of dropdown-trigger

# v4.7.8

- Removed id #searchbox from px-dropdown and used the class variable .search\_\_box.
- This ensures no duplicate 'non-unique id' error that chrome console checks for.

# v4.7.6

- fix event documentation

# v4.7.5

- fix width inheritance of content on resize
- close dropdown when trigger tapped again

# v4.7.4

- fix width inheritance of content

# v4.7.3

- fix width inheritance

# v4.7.2

- revert all accidental sass changes from 4.7.0

# v4.7.1

- fix mobile responsiveness

# v4.7.0

- add disable-truncate property for content items

# v4.6.0

- Adding px-overlay-content to optionally hoist content.
- px-dropdown was broken up into two sub components to facilitate hoisting.
  - Adds JS to dynamically watch for a trigger element to be added to the trigger slot so we can avoid breaking the API. We can't just pass the trigger down because in v1 Shadow DOM slots passed down twice that are empty still wipe out any
    default content.
  - Refactor px-dropdown-content to just listen for click event emitting from the trigger
  - Move all code that deals with items into px-dropdown-content to cleanly seperate concerns. px-dropdown is just a wrapper that connects the trigger and content together and passes properties and slotted content down.
